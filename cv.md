## Hobby:
I am keen on reading. I can tell that I mostly prefer classic literature.
On my free time I like to do many things apart from reading, but there is one thing that is taking the biggest part of my time and it’s gym. I have been going to the gym for 3 years now and I go there 3 times a week.
Beyond that I’ve been a major follower of F1 since 2012. My big dream is to visit some Grand Prix.
